# Calm
Panic is a thing most software engineers will encounter in their careers. Things break. Sites go dark. People get upset. This is a chance to practice working with this discomfort in a place that is safe. You are surrounded by people doing what you're doing, and who care about you. If you are panicking and unable to work, *do something different*.

*The ability to reset your mind is a skill you can learn with practice. Today is a day to practice.*

Things to try, in order. You can quit whenever you're ready to go back to work.

Talk to your instructor.

Get up and take a walk.

Set a timer and sit quietly with your eyes closed for five minutes. Listen to your breathing.

Done all of that? Awesome. Take a really, really deep breath. No really, deeper. Hold it. Lungs are weird. Seriously, like you have this bag in your chest full of whatever happened to be nearby. Breathe out. Draw a picture of a lung on a sticky. Think about how weird it is.

Wiggle your toes. Notice how they feel right now. Which toes feel the best? *Sensory input can engage parts of your brain that are less emotional*.

What's the number of toes in this room divided by the number of lungs? *Math engages parts of your brain that aren't worked up. Doing simple math can reset your brain.* Try it.

*Black humor is a coping strategy. Is there a building you'd like to set on fire right now? BWAHAHAHAAAHAA.* But don't. Really, please don't.  

Draw another picture of a lung. So weird.

Deeeeeeeeeep breath. Actually do it.

You got this. Go code.
